# ds_module5_matplot_challenge
In this challenge, I acted as an employee at a pharmaceutical compamy that specializes in cancer treatments. I analysed the data from a set of 249 mice who were treated with a range of drug regimens. I used Jupyter Notebook and MatPlotLib to prepare data, generate statistics, and create visual grapghs among other things.
